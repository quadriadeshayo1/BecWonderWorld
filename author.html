            <h2>Writing with storyboards</h2>
            <h2>For grade six - nine</h2>
            <p>Writing with storyboards was conceived and packaged  to enable students/pupils in 
                primary and secondary schools to assess themselves of how much they think they know about creative writing (story writing)
                and challenge them to improve thier literary writing skills. It is meant for schools as creative writing assessment books
                and for private use at home. <br>
                I believe that every knowledge and human activity should end with the production or achievement of something tangible or intangible.
                Therefore the knowledge of creative writing as a course of study and a process to translate into the production of 
                literary works. This workbook provides briefs explanation of the main elements, concepts, styles and technique of a story.
